                  App built for Hong Kong Internation Airport. I was so
                  fortunate to have the opportunity to work in this project, i
                  was in charge of two apps one built for final user and one as
                  terminal for the warehouse management, unfourtunately, i can't
                  comment as much as i want about this project, or even share
                  it, since it was decided to be delivered only to closed group
                  of users. But i'm allowed to mention that this was a very huge
                  and important project for my carreer it involved the use of
                  AI, Face Recognition, Objects Detection, Offline Support, Push
                  notifications, websockets, among other functionalities.
